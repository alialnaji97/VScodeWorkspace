Problem: Terrain Altitude Mapping
You are given an N x N grid representing a map, where each cell contains either True (representing water) or False (representing land).


Your task is to write a function that returns an N x N grid where:
* Cells with True (water) must have an altitude level of 0.
* Cells with False (land) must have an altitude level of 1 or greater.
* The altitude level of a land cell is determined by its shortest distance to any water cell. The further a land cell is from any water cell, the higher its altitude level.


Example
Input:
[
    [True, False, False],
    [False, False, False],
    [False, False, True]
]
Output:
[
    [0, 1, 2],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 1, 0]
]


Notes:
- The level of each land cell increases by 1 for each step away from the nearest water cell.
- Cells are considered adjacent if they are directly above, below, to the left, or to the right of another cell (no diagonal adjacency).
